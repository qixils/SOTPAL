# SOTPAL

Discord bot for playing games of Some Of These People Are Lying. Inspired
by [Two Of These People Are Lying](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfx61sxf1Yz2I-c7eMRk9wBUUDCJkU7H0).

## Usage

[Java 17](https://adoptium.net/) or greater is required to compile and run this software.

The project is compiled using maven (`mvn package`) or downloaded
from [Releases](https://github.com/qixils/SOTPAL/releases).

The bot's token is supplied either as a command-line argument
(`java -jar SOTPAL.jar INSERT_TOKEN_HERE`) or as the first line in a text file named `token.txt`
located in the working directory.
